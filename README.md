# Leaf
**This repository contains an incomplete, legacy version of Leaf's compiler, which is currently being re-written.
This is just a messy proof of concept and should be taken as such. This repo will soon be archived and replaced by a new, proper version of the compiler.**

Leaf is new performance focused cross-platform programming language, which doesn't sacrifice readability and user friendliness.

Leaf aims to offer a unified cross-platform experience, supporting both native code generation through LLVM, and .Net integration through CLR assemblies.
